## 💡 Why?

We build our landing pages using static site generators instead of heavy, database-driven CMS platforms. This keeps our websites fast, stable, and highly compatible, which is ideal for performance-focused projects and ad campaigns.

But managing content this way is not easy. Writing and editing Markdown files, especially in multiple languages, quickly becomes painful and time-consuming.

Markdown++ solves this problem.
It is a lightweight editor for static sites that makes creating, editing, and managing Markdown content simple, fast, and collaborative without compromising performance.
